# Tic-tac-toe ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe))

A fun coding exercise to learn about the minimax-algorithm and get acquainted with "streamlit" and its session_state function. I've since also uploaded code to run it using fastAPI (with websockets) and flask (with and without websockets).

                            ❌ ❌ ⭕️
                            ⭕️ ⭕️ ❌
                            ❌ ⭕️ ❌ 

In this implementation, you will play against a bot which is using the minimax-algorithm to compute the best move. 

I'm sorry to say the best you can do is tie. Don't believe me? Play [here](https://snagel.io/#tictactoe)!

Have fun!
